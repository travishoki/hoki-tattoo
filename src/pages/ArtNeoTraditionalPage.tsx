			<p>What are the rules to neo traditional?</p>
			<p>
				Neo-traditional is a tattoo style that combines elements of traditional
				tattooing with contemporary influences. While the rules of neo
				traditional tattooing are not rigidly defined, there are some common
				characteristics that can be observed:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Bold Outlines: Neo traditional tattoos typically feature bold, clean
					outlines that define the design and give it a distinct and
					recognizable appearance.
				</li>
				<li>
					Limited Color Palette: The color palette used in neo-traditional
					tattoos is often more vibrant and varied compared to traditional
					tattoos. However, it is still typically limited to a specific range of
					colors, often with a preference for rich and saturated tones.
				</li>
				<li>
					Symbolic Imagery: Neo traditional tattoos often incorporate
					traditional tattoo motifs such as animals, flowers, skulls, hearts,
					and other classic designs. These elements are often rendered in a more
					stylized and illustrative manner, with added depth, shading, and
					detail.
				</li>
				<li>
					High Contrast: A key characteristic of neo traditional tattoos is the
					use of high contrast. This involves a strong interplay between light
					and dark areas within the design, achieved through shading, stippling,
					and color saturation. This technique adds dimension and visual impact
					to the tattoo.
				</li>
				<li>
					Artistic Freedom: One of the defining aspects of neo-traditional
					tattooing is the freedom for artists to reinterpret traditional
					designs and incorporate their own artistic flair. This allows for
					greater creativity, innovation, and personalization within the style.
				</li>
